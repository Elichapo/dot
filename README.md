# Config
This repository contains my personal configuration files for various programs on [Arch Linux](www.archlinux.org). While primarily designed for Arch, some configurations may work on other Arch-based distributions or even other operating systems. I primarliy use arch as my main opearting system i got windows but that's just or gaming.


## What's Included:

* [Neovim](www.neovim.io): My configuration for the powerful Neovim text editor.
* [Zsh](www.zsh.org): My Zsh configuration for a productive and customized shell experience.
* [Awesome](www.awesome.org): Configuration for my preferred window manager (Awesome WM).
* [Alacritty](www.alacritty.org): My configuration for the lightweight and fast Alacritty terminal emulator.
* [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar): Configuration for the customizable and efficient Polybar for displaying information on your desktop.
* [Ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger): Configuration for the file manager Ranger with enhanced functionality.
* [Dunst](https://dunst-project.org/): Configuration for the lightweight and customizable Dunst notification manager.

# My Development Environment:

* Operating System: Arch Linux
* Hardware: AMD Ryzen 3 PRO 5000 series
* Window Manager: Awesome WM - My primary choice for window management, paired with Polybar for a customizable desktop experience (yes, I know some might consider it redundant with Polybar, but it works for me!).
* Alternatives: I also appreciate Dynamic Window Manager (DWM) and Binary Space Partitioning Window Manager (BSPWM) for their unique approaches.
* Picom Fork (by iBhagwan): Adds transparency and visual enhancements.
* Alacritty: My preferred lightweight and fast terminal emulator (with kitty or st as backups).
* Neovim: Powerful and customizable text editor.
